# Credit Risk Modelling

This is credit risk modeling that refers to IFRS 9. The objective is to determine the probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default using several machine learning tools. Apart from using historical data and credit related information from borrowers, I also use macroeconomic data for the past year and forecast results for the future. This notebook is still in the development stage.

The dataset is taken from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/yousuf28/prosper-loan
